Final Assignment: Business Statistics - Professional Product (7023BST_BP)
This repository contains the final project for the Business Statistics course. Our project involves analyzing two datasets—Tmall and Tao Yin—through exploratory data analysis, hypothesis testing, and multivariate statistical methods, with a focus on creating clusters and conducting feature engineering.

Assignment Overview
The assignment is divided into two sub-assignments:

  Sub-assignment 1: Choose one of the provided datasets, Tmall or RetailRocket (our group selected Tmall).
  Sub-assignment 2: Analyze the Tao Yin dataset, a mandatory component for all groups.
  
Both sub-assignments contribute equally to the final grade and involve formulating research questions, conducting exploratory data analysis, and developing statistical models. The primary goal is to use data analysis to gain insights into customer behavior, product features, and other factors that influence sales and performance metrics.

Datasets
Tmall Dataset: Chosen for Sub-assignment 1, this dataset allows us to explore various customer transactions and product features on the Tmall e-commerce platform. We analyze trends, identify segments, and test relevant hypotheses.
Tao Yin Dataset: Compulsory for Sub-assignment 2, this dataset includes rich features that allow us to create product clusters, apply principal component analysis, and investigate similarities across items.

Deliverables
  1 Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb): A comprehensive report on data exploration, modeling, and analysis, fully documented with code comments.
  2 Presentation Video (.mp4): A 10-minute presentation summarizing findings, where each team member explains their contributions.
